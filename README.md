## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Nx plugins and code generators

Add Nx plugins to leverage their code generators and automated, inferred tasks.

```
# Add plugin
npx nx add @nx/react

# Use code generator
npx nx generate @nx/react:app demo

# Run development server
npx nx serve demo

# View project details
npx nx show project demo --web
```

Run `npx nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [code generators](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code) and [inferred tasks](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks) in the docs.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.

## Leveraging AI in Software Development

Through the integration of AI technology, we have the ability to automate monotonous tasks, augment decision-making processes, and in the grand scheme of things, streamline the entire software development lifecycle. This system is not merely a testament to the capabilities of AI, but it also highlights the potential of human creativity when used to aid others in their success.

The implementation of **@wrkspce** in product development embraces a conceptual, stepwise approach:

### ðŸŽ¨ Design & Describe

---

> With @wrkspce, users can leverage the power of AI technology to define their systems more effectively. This tool harnesses Language Model Learning (LLM) to simplify processes, enhancing operational efficiency. Ultimately, this empowers users to visualize and design their systems in a more intuitive manner, enriching the overall user experience.
> 

### ðŸ’¬ Chat & Configure

---

> The user interacts with our AI tool, which is trained on the system. This allows the tool to extrapolate details in real time, revolutionizing business operations and setting a new standard for efficiency and innovation.
> 

### ðŸ“š Generate Libraries, Docs, Tasks & More

---

> Our AI tool provides automatic generation of project scaffolding, inclusive of readme files with detailed documentation, subtasks, and useful prompts. This ensures developers have all the necessary resources at their disposal while creating project code.
